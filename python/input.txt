"Now like to bees in summer's heate from hives,
Out flie the citizens, some here, some there;
Some all alone, and others with their wives:
With wives and children some flie, all for feare !

Here stands a watch, with guard of partizans,
To stoppe their passages, or to or fro,
As if they were not men, nor Christians,
But fiends or monsters, murdering as they go.

Each village, free, now stands upon her guard,
None must have harbour in them but their owne;
And as for life and death all watch and ward,
And flie for life (as death) the man unknowne !"

---- Sir John Davies (1569 â€“ 1626)
