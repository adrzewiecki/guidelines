# IAI Python Style Guide

We follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). This document highlights a number of peculiarities to pay special attention to, as well as complements the Google style guide on issues not specified there.

## Highlighted from the Google Python Style Guide

  * Maximum line length is 80 characters.
  * Indent code blocks with 4 spaces.
  * Use parentheses sparingly.
  * Naming: `module_name`, `package_name`, `ClassName`, `method_name`, `ExceptionName`, `function_name`, `GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME`, `global_var_name`, `instance_var_name`, `function_parameter_name`, `local_var_name`
    - Avoid dashes (`-`) in any package/module name.


## Amendments to the Google Python Style Guide

  * Use single quotes everywhere, except docstrings.

However, any other IDE may be used as long as it is configured according to the settings below.
