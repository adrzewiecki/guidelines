# IAI Markdown Style Guide

## Naming conventions

  * README files are to be named all-caps `README.md`.
  * Other files names are capitalized (i.e., first letter of a word in uppercase, and the rest of the letters in lowercase) and `_` -separated (e.g., `Writing_style.md`).

## Markup

  * Top-level lists are marked by `*`, second, third, etc. levels below are marked by `-`. E.g.,

```
  * List item 1
  * List item 2
    - Sub item 21
      - Sub item 211
    - Sub item 22
  * List item 3
```
