# Supervision Guidelines

## Rules of engagement

There are a few simple rules that every supervised student is expected to follow.

### Meetings

  * Meetings are held at regular (usually weekly) intervals that are agreed at the beginning of the semester.
  * The preferred way of meeting is face-to-face (excepting cases of illness or restrictions).
  * If you want to meet outside the regular slot, you need to make an appointment via email. Due to a busy schedule, if you drop in unannounced, you should expect to be turned away.
  * Show up on time and be mindful of the allocated meeting time.
  * You need to come to the meetings preparred with an agenda and keep notes (see below).
  * If you need to cancel the meeting, that's fine. Cancelling the meeting three times during the semester (excepting cases of illness) means you resign from the project effective immediately.

### Main activities

A thesis project typically involves three main type of activities:

  * Coding: Writing code, generating data, and running experiments.
  * Reading: Reading both scientific papers and technical documentation.
  * Writing: Editing your thesis (adding, editing, and removing text).

During different periods, some will of these activities will be more pronounced than others. However, you want to do all three, every week.

### Agenda and notes

  * At the beginning of the semester, set up a Google document for keeping notes, by instantiating [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXrqKV7CYZxWgo4pQ6a7bW9CB78yH-Xf1vTLBJiDFUE/edit?usp=sharing) and sharing it with your supervisor(s).
  * Prepare an agenda for the meeting. It ensures that the meeting has a clear purpose.
    - If you don't have an agenda at the beginning of the meeting, then the meeting is over.
    - Failing to prepare an agenda 3 times amounts to your resignation from the project.
  * The agenda should be structured as follows:
    1. Progress update from last week:
       - Prefix each item with one of "[coding]", "[reading]", or "[writing]".
    2. Questions/blockers: 
       - These are issues that are holding you back and would need help with.
    3. Discussion notes: 
       - Initialize it with a list of things you want to discuss during the meeting.
       - Your notes taken during the meeting also come here.
    4. Action items:
       - These are your TODOs for the next week. Prefix each item with one of "[coding]", "[reading]", or "[writing]".
  * If there are items that need preparation from the supervisor's end (i.e., the questions/blockers block is not empty), make sure you share the agenda at least 24 hours before the meeting (by emailing the link to your Google document).


### Thesis

The thesis is your main deliverable and should be your #1 priority!

*(Further information on thesis writing -structure, milestones, resources- will be added here.)*

  * Follow the [IAI Scientific Writing Guidelines](https://github.com/iai-group/guidelines/tree/main/writing).

### Coding

The code (and generated data/results) are the secondary deliverables. You should aim for making it publicly releasable on GitHub.

  * We adhere to the [IAI Guidelines](https://github.com/iai-group/guidelines).
